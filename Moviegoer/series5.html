				  <h3>The Deuce</h3>
				  by George Pelecanos, David Simon<br>
				  IMDBb: 8.1/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 96%, Google Users: 91%<br>
				  Genre: Drama<br>
				  Description: Created by George Pelecanos and David Simon, who also collaborated on HBO's "The Wire" and "Treme," the semi fictional drama series "The Deuce" tells of the germination of the sex-trade industry in the heart of New York's Times Square. It's the early 1970s, and the porn business begins a shift from organized crime-backed parlors to a legitimate, culturally accepted enterprise. A cast of barkeeps, prostitutes, pimps, police and nightlife seekers centers around twins Vincent and Frankie Martino (James Franco, in a dual role), who navigate the sex business after meeting well-connected mobster Rudy Pipilo. Their storyline, among others, merges with that of prostitute Candy, whose ambition and intelligence lead her to a more prominent role in the industry.<br>

				  Comment Reviews on Season 3
				  <ol>User Review:	Riverdale is still my favorite show of all time. This is my favorite season of the whole series so far. The writing, screenplays, and storylines continue to be spectacular and are the best this season. The cast performances are still stupendous especially Cole Sprouse, Lili Reinhart, KJ Apa, Madelaine Petsch, Camila Mendes, Skeet Ulrich, Vanessa Morgan, Luke Perry, Casey Cott, MÃ¤dchen Amick, Ashleigh Murray, Drew Ray Tanner, Cody Kearsley, Mark Consuelos, Marisol Nichols, Martin Cummins, Tiera Skovbye, Jordan Connor, and Robin Givens. The scenery and sets are still beautiful just like they have been since season one. A+.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: It's an okay show, Not great writing nor is the acting particularly phenomenal. Definitively not understanding what is going on with season 3. Took on a whole new direction and its very strange.</ol></div>

Now, faced with the impossible, they're all given a second chance. But as their new realities become clear, a deeper mystery unfolds, and some of the returned passengers soon realize they may be meant for something greater than they ever thought possible.<br>

				  <ol>Critic Review:Matthew Weiner's return to television is as handsomely made as it is ambitious and sprawling unfortunately, it's also fatally indulgent, asking for the utmost patience from audiences without a compelling incentive.</ol></div>

				  <ol>User Review: Watching the team mobilize and literally deflate a mechanic is an effective early example of how compact and efficient some of these "911" stories can sometimes be.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: 911 is constantly operating at such a high emotional level that it would take something really drastic to make a severe challenge for everyone involved. Lucky for them, that snaking line of cracked pavement looks like the chance for them to do just that. The real test, though, is what 911 is ready to do when the dust settles.</ol></div>

				  <ol>Critic Review: At times suggesting an unholy fusion of an anything-goes musical telenovela like Glee or Cop Rock and an anti-hero drama built around a charismatic screw-up, the series is mesmerizing in part because it continues to exist and try new things despite being out there all by its lonesome.</ol></div>

				  Comment Reviews on Season 14
				  <ol>User Review: I loved this series. But, it started a nosedive crash into boredom and sloppiness with the introduction of new actors in place of Thomas Gibson and Matthew Gray Gubler. The new characters are dull, drab, hamming their roles and do not fit with the group nicely. The run-time of the episodes also dropped and they wander off into the personal lives of the characters. Is it just me who feeling the show is going downhill or other fans too? I hope they will come back to bring the show to its former status.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: I have watched each episode of Criminal Minds, and I agree with the writer from Canada about this show. Mandy Patinkin turns anything he's in to pure gold, and I hope "Criminal Minds" will get a long run! The plots are engaging, the cast interacts well together, and nobody comes off as being too "preachy," as you get with some of the CSIs and Law & Orders. Shows like Criminal Minds and Numbers and NCIS manage to make you think you've watched a complete story; and from my point of view, I respond to that kind of entertainment much, much better!
