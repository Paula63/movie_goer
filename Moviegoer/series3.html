The show revolves around the Harmons, a family of three, who move from Boston to Los Angeles in order to reconcile past anguish. What the Harmons don't know is that the house they've moved into is haunted. But it's not haunted by Casperesque friendly ghosts it's haunted by demonic creatures. The creatures have a history of not only spooking the house's residents but also devouring them. After living in this house, family patriarch and psychiatrist, Ben, may need a shrink of his own.<br>

				  <ol>Critic Review: Ryan Murphy goes full Ryan Murphy in "Apocalypse Then," barreling past two convoluted episodes of multiverse building to deliver a satisfying, batsh--t finale that lives up to its namesake.

				  Comment Reviews on Season 30
				  <ol>User Review: At the start of its 30th season, The Simpsons celebrates by either consciously or unconsciously attempting to recapture the essence of the show&rsquo;s genius earlier seasons. With Bart&rsquo;s Not Dead, the series puts away (mostly) its recent crutch of non sequiturs, and especially the unnecessary flights of fancy, as seen in the unimpressive season 29 medieval Simpsons premiere, to tell a story most definitely in the show&rsquo;s wheelhouse, and one that also allows its writers to take aim at one of their most frequent targets.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review:[The premiere] at least indicates an interest in character-focused stories going forward that's a lot more intriguing than any splashy stunt casting or reality-busting fantasy would be.</ol></div>

				  Genre: Mockumentary<br>
				  Description:Description: True-crime series are gaining popularity on TV so, of course, there was bound to be a satire of the genre. "American Vandal" takes a look at the aftermath of various high school pranks. Aspiring student documentarian Peter Maldonado takes it upon himself, with help from friend Sam Ecklund, to investigate the cases and find out exactly who is responsible for the crimes. After looking into vandalism at a public high school, Peter and Sam head to a Catholic school after the cafeteria's lemonade is contaminated with laxatives. In the style of the genre it lampoons, the series leaves viewers wondering who the real perpetrator is until the very end.<br>

				  <ol>User Review: It's more interested in the truth of true crime than the crime itself, and in treating its characters like the flawed, frightened people they are, it finds it. All that, and poop jokes, too.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: American Vandal trades one type of potty humor for another in an ambitious second season that manages to double down on the explicit gags while subtly addressing serious social issues.</ol></div>

				  Genre: Dark Comedy<br>
				  Description: Disillusioned at the thought of taking down another "mark," depressed, low-level hit man Barry Berkman seeks a way out. When the Midwesterner reluctantly travels to Los Angeles to execute a hit on an actor who is bedding a mobster's wife, little does Barry know that the City of Angels may be his sanctuary. He follows his target into acting class and ends up instantly drawn to the community of eager hopefuls, especially dedicated student Sally, who becomes the object of his affection. While Barry wants to start a new life as an actor, his handler, Fuches, has other ideas, and the hit man's criminal past won't let him walk away so easily.<br>
