						49. TRUE DETECTIVE

							<p>
								Plot: In 2012, Louisiana State Police Detectives Rust Cohle and Martin Hart are brought in to revisit a homicide case they worked in 1995. As the inquiry unfolds in present day through separate interrogations, the two former detectives narrate the story of their investigation, reopening unhealed wounds, and drawing into question their supposed solving of a bizarre ritualistic murder in 1995. The timelines braid and converge in 2012 as each man is pulled back into a world they believed they'd left behind. In learning about each other and their killer, it becomes clear that darkness lives on both sides of the law.

								Critic Review: In True Detective, performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey reel the viewer in, while the style, vision and direction make it hard to turn away.
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Watched both seasons, season 1 was outstanding and breath-taking loved the ending. Although it’s slow at the start but as it progresses it is worth the watch but season 2 was not that good, it’s not worth 9.1 on IMDb.

								Audience Review: It was so ahead of its time and innovative with it's incredible jokes and foreshadowing. AD's running gags are the best. Season 4 is not AS good but still funny. However, season 1-3 are comedic genius.

								Critic Review: One of television's top-ranked series and the recipient of numerous Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations, "Friends" is a smart, sophisticated comedy that investigates the hearts and minds of a group of friends living in New York. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review:This sitcom is great. I can't get enough of 'FRIENDS'. In my opinion, this sitcom is more about the story of "ROSS & RACHEL". Every season finale episode is about "ROSS & RACHEL" except season 6 which is about "CHANDLER & MONICA". And I really liked that.

								Critic Review: House of Cards folds slightly under the weight of its labyrinthian ending -- thankfully Robin Wright's commanding performance is more than enough to keep it standing strong. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: The last season of House of Cards bears little, if no, resemblance to the previous seasons. The missing character of Frank Underwood proves fatal to the series. The revolving door of random characters that enter and exit the drama only prove to be confusing to the viewer as we try to understand the conspiracy behind the presidency.

								Critic Review: This series is about the bonds of family and heated power struggles--with a big dose of vampiric hedonism mixed in. Sounds like the makings of something pretty fang-tastic. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: I have always thought that vampire-based series were real cheesy and the only reason I decided to watch this show was because of the ratings and that all my favourite shows were at an end. What a pleasant surprise it was! The show is full of little twists and turns and got me hooked from the very first episode.
