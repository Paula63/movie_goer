					  <ol>User Review: Marvel's most unusual film of its Cinematic Universe is big on world-building, empowerment, strong (female) characters and jabs at the
					  current state of the world. All that mixed with the ingredients of a blockbuster film, a great cast, good humorous timing and spectacular set pieces makes for a very entertaining ride that works as a standalone film as well as part of the bigger picture.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: The problem with this Avengers movie is not that it is confusing, with its huge amount of characters and parallel plots, but sloppily written and lazy in the way it brings them together, with annoying plot holes and lacking in enough urgency to make any death really matter.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: I always struggle with stories that toe the line between original and weird, and this is one. It was interesting at times but also had me furrowing my eyebrows at others. Beyond that, the directing was good, the acting was average and the score was unsettling, though probably intentionally. While this film is fascinating at times, it is just get a little too abstract for my liking.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Annihilation backs up its Sci-Fi visual wonders and visceral genre thrills with an impressively ambitious and surprisingly strange exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: It is a pity that the identity of the villain is so obvious, and I also find it funny that no one even considers using Voyd's power as a solution in the movie's climax, but never mind, this is a great sequel that manages to be thrilling, hilarious and more visually stunning than ever.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Incredibles 2 reunites Pixar's family crimefighting team for a long-awaited follow-up that may not quite live up to the original, but comes close enough to earn its name.</ol>#

					  <ol>User Review: This movie was a nice change to the usual horror/thrillers which are all the same. It had me on edge the entire film. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend. Best horror/thriller I've seen in such a long time.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: John Krasinski&#8217;s &#8220;A Quiet Place&#8221; is a nerve-shredder. It&#8217;s a movie designed to make you an active participant in a game of tension, not just a passive observer in an unfolding horror. Most of the great horror movies are so because we become actively invested in the fate of the characters and involved in the cinematic exercise playing out before us. It is a tight thrill ride the kind of movie that quickens the heart rate and plays with the expectations of the audience, while never treating them like idiots. In other words, it&#8217;s a really good horror movie.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: For every 10 min of "jocular" conversation, there is 2 min of story. And the story is nothing which you haven't seen before. Few jokes bring out a smile or laughter, but eventually the biggest the joke is made by director on us, with this lazy writing and weak story. If you care for your time, just watch DP 1.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, Deadpool 2 is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: A nice adventure in the Star Wars Universe. No more, no less. I enjoyed most of the movie. The negativity on this page is disturbing.What did you guys expect from an Anthology film? Ehrenreich does a decent job,the story is at least ok and contains a nice surprise in the end.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: As unnecessary prequels go, "Solo: A Star Wars Story" isn't bad. It's not great, either, though&#8212;and despite spirited performances, knockabout humor, and a few surprising or rousing bits, there's something a bit too programmed about the whole thing. It has certain marks to hit, and it makes absolutely sure you know that it's hitting them</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: A well acted, slow burn family tragedy with solemn and moody storytelling. First time director Ari Aster gradually and effectively

					  <ol>User Review: Despite its annoying excess of exposition, this exciting retro-futuristic salad of pop-culture references from the 1980s and 1990s is a wonderful return to form for Spielberg, who makes this a blast for cinephiles and gamers while also offering a welcome anti-neoliberal message.</ol>
