								Critic Review: Stranger Things' slow-building sophomore season balances moments of humour and a nostalgic sweetness against a growing horror that's more effective thanks to the show's full-bodied characters and evocative tone.
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: The hype to me doesn't match the lasting impression on the show *BUT* still a great show nonetheless. This show revolves around a bunch of middle schooler’s, so it has those IT vibes, because of this I think you must be pre-teen to connect to this show on a deeper level.

								Critic Review: In its final season, “Rectify” endures as a vital and compelling drama, poignantly driven by a narrative that envelops its characters in complexity, humanity, and a bittersweet beauty.
							</p>

								Audience Review: There has never been a TV drama like Rectify and there may never be another. It is the product of a singular but throughout its run, it was clear that everyone who worked on it, from cast and crew to writers and producers, were on the same page, probably one taken from the New Testament.

Every character in this show has their own vulnerability and radiance which ranges from NYU drop-out to drug-dealer rapper and interestingly, a slacker intellectual in his own personal league.

The camera angles and cinematography are a work of art.
