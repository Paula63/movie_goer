She's also surprised to learn that Nick's family is extremely wealthy and he's considered one of the country's most eligible bachelors.

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: This is a good movie that really shoots right down the middle for mass appeal. It does touch on some intricate details about growing up and living with an Asian family but really plays out as fancy blockbuster rom-com. Since this film does naturally come from a different angle than most rom-coms, however, with different issues and obstacles, it at least stands out. The B-story involving Astrid seems rushed and incomplete but leaves open the option for a sequel that will explore her more, which I would like to see.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: With a terrific cast and a surfeit of visual razzle dazzle, Crazy Rich Asians takes a satisfying step forward for screen representation while deftly drawing inspiration from the classic and still effective rom-com formula</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: This is a good movie that really shoots right down the middle for mass appeal. It doe How to deliver a film based on a video game known for its lust appeal, physicality, and some few puzzles to figure out? Well, this is more than simply a decent attempt, that's yards better than the previous one. Vikander provides the charisma aplenty and the action fully engages the physicality of the video games. Interestingly, the "little girl looking for her long lost Dad" angle was possibly the weakest element here. Felt like the second one would be better somehow.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Tomb Raider reboots the franchise with a more grounded approach and a star who's clearly more than up to the task neither of which are well served by an uninspired origin story.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: One step further along the Sci-Fi trail in the woods from Blade Runner, Matrix, (and Prometheus), this looks at the possible outcome beyond plastic surgery, but physical modification through nanotechnology. Characterizations are a little undercooked beyond the main character but the film is still a great deal of fun and a worthy consideration for a weekend night.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Like its augmented protagonist, Upgrade's old-fashioned innards get a high-tech boost one made even more powerful thanks to sharp humor and a solidly well-told story.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: This film is good for some laughs, but it's ultimately just three C- to C+ comedic actors coming together with some okay young actresses to create a film that is exactly the sum of its parts. Even this film's biggest fans likely only enjoyed it to a certain degree. Mann, Cena and Barinholtz all have a certain chemistry, but overall this movie is very high floor, low ceiling, and forgettable in the end.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  Blockers puts a gender-swapped spin on the teen sex comedy one elevated by strong performances, a smartly funny script, and a surprisingly enlightened perspective.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: On the one hand the movie delivers on the heavy metal imagery and Nicolas Cage chainsaw fights it promises, on the other hand this is a strangely ponderous piece of work that is also somehow pretentious. I feel like Cosmatos could easily have shaved 30-40 minutes off this by not having every character take 5 minutes to get a single sentence out of their mouths.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: A light investigation of our entire world society with trust issues told through the device of a Russian woman forced against her will to be a deep-cover spy (convincingly played by Lawrence). And indeed, the idea that no one can be trusted permeates the work. Saving grace comes in the form of one relationship wherein she can commit And the film falters ultimately because that connection has no inner heat to drive it, for us to connect to. I believe it to be a casting problem. Still, not unwatchable.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  Red Sparrow aims for smart, sexy spy thriller territory, but Jennifer Lawrence's committed performance isn't enough to compensate for thin characters and a convoluted story.</ol>
