								Critic Review: Heath Ledger pitches in a breath-taking performance as Batman's arch rival in Christopher Nolan's breath-taking rendition of the comic book hero's second caper after Batman Begins. (Times of India)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be "152 minutes of pure awesomeness." Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book.

								Critic Review: Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, "The Godfather" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. (Elliot Panek, Common Sense Media)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to The Godfather. But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.
