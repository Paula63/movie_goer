							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: A lot of people are crazy about this show. So, I decided to give it a shot. I watched the Pilot and then the second and third episode and so on. Soon enough, The Vampire Diaries became my all-time favourite tv show ever. It has everything- a remarkable story, extremely loveable characters and eight awesome seasons.

								Critic Review: For a purposely misleading series that prided itself on all its enigmas, Castle Rock answered its major questions in unexpected and impressive ways, while once again tying itself to the greater King universe. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Watched the finale today. It‚Äôs really an awesome series. Requires patience but that is worth the whole season. Just that all questions weren't answered at the end and still leaves us at a major dilemma.

								Critic Review: Narcos continues to evolve in its third season, drawing on historical details to take viewers on a thoroughly gripping -- and unsettlingly timely -- journey into darkness.  
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: The "Narcos" is as enjoyable as "Breaking Bad". Wagner Moura's performance is beyond words. Paulina Ruiz's portrayal in the role as Pablo Escobar's wife is a delight to watch and their chemistry is unmissable and in fact it really inspires I guess a lot of people to respect and believe in husband wife relationship despite worst of the worst conditions.

								Critic Review: Twin Peaks plays with TV conventions to deliver a beguiling -- and unsettling -- blend of seemingly disparate genres, adding up to an offbeat drama with a distinctly unique appeal. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Twin Peaks is not only responsible for changing the landscape of Television forever, but it also makes other popular TV shows look like child's play.
