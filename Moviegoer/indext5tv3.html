								Critic Review: Bryan Fuller serves up another delightfully demented season of Hannibal, featuring a hearty helping of gorgeous gore, paired with a sweet side of twisted humour. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: The series is by far the most accurate and stunning portrayal of a very cunning serial killer. What sets it apart from series like Dexter is its excellent cinematography, choreography and script, the dialogues are so apt and thought of that they are poetry and filled with layers of meaning.

							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Season 5 was critically acclaimed as being scattered and lazy however I found the season to be quite interesting and another possible favourite season because of the insight and results of season 4’s tragic death.

								Critic Review: The final season of Boardwalk Empire is as visually dazzling and well-acted as ever, but it's the emphasis on Nucky Thompson's history that's particularly rewarding this time out.
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: One of the best written/directed/acted/designed shows on today. Don't make me send Raylon to straighten you out. The acting and cinematography is spot-on, and it is a very addictive show. It pulls you straight into the action in the first episode. Its writing is great, and the actors fit the characters perfectly.

								Critic Review: You may be shocked by the leaden pace of a studio-based drama from Britain in the '70s, I know I was, but I soon found myself binging with ease; the script bubbles, the acting fizzes.  
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: he could hardly have chosen a more fascinating subject than the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Even a tame retelling, based strictly on verified historical fact, would have made an interesting tale. But by embracing the lurid, sensationalistic hyperbole heaped upon the founders of the Roman Empire by later writers, Graves concocted the ultimate in dysfunctional families, weaving a tale of scandal and debauchery capable of shocking even the most jaded of modern audiences.

Love Deadwood it’s been well researched and just like the wild west including the language. If your easily offended in very bad swear words don’t watch. In fact, don’t watch anything western as that’s how they rolled.

								Critic Review: House is a brilliant show medically speaking but so much more than that at the same time. The show is a kind of "24" meets medicine extravaganza. The main character, Dr. Gregory House, is played beautifully by Hugh Laurie. Dr. House is a bitter but brilliant doctor who is crippled in one leg due to the inability of doctors to properly diagnose his problem in time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: Truly one of my favourite shows of all time. Hugh Laurie will keep you hooked to the show. He plays an anti-social/sarcastic doctor with a talented team and the episodes consist of them diagnosing various illnesses/ diseases etc. In each episode, the story advances gradually with the different problems that rise with House as well as his team.
