Description: No wonder they say that the Japanese school system is the
hardest and most severe. For the guy by the name of Otonashi (the name
he forgot) woke up in the next world - and there again school! But,
despite the beautiful wrapping, this school is more like a correctional
colony for those who left the mortal world too early and did not have
time (or did not want) to know the rules and laws of "real society".
That is, the young person who has been brought up will twist in her,
will learn to walk in order and participate in extracurricular
activities according to the plan - and it's time to go to the stage
according to the accumulated karma. But for some reason, not everybody
likes this ...<br>
      <br>
The most diverse students who decided not to disappear, but to figure
out for what and from whom they received the &#8220;new term&#8221;, informally
united, creating the &#8220;Front of the Underworld&#8221; under the command of the
strong-willed and practical Yuri. Their goal is to get answers, their
life is the rejection of the rules imposed, and the means to achieve
the goal is the eternal struggle with the administration and the
&#8220;mistress&#8221; of the school named Tensi (angel). Otonashi, the main
character, involuntarily joined such a negative company. Now the guy is
guaranteed a fun life, true friends and a subscription to the concerts
of the best local group &#8220;Dead Girls and Miracle Yudo&#8221;. It's only the
beginning!<br>

Year of release: 2015<br>
Genre: action, comedy, fantasy<br>
Episodes: 12<br>
Directed by: Natsume Shingo<br>
      <br>
Description: In the comic book universe, no one is surprised by
monsters, villains, and mad scientists. They are like natural phenomena
- unpleasant, of course, but what can you do? The main thing is to have
enough heroes to protect ordinary people, and then - how lucky. And it
is necessary for such a thing to happen that Saitama - the strongest of
the heroes of Zet City - is not at all like a fighter for peace and
justice: bald, short, expressionless face, clothes, even less able to
stand in a pose and express themselves pathetically!<br>
      <br>
The fact is that Saitama is not a secret stranger, a mutant or a
billionaire, but only an unemployed person who once decided to become
stronger and live with his mind. For three years, the atypical hero has
grown so much that with one blow he sends out even Superman, even the
Prince of Darkness. Truly, if you wish, anyone can become a Buddha -
but Saitama just does not want to, this is a desire to live, play,
accept recognition. And if so, you will have to work for the image -
take, for example, as students of the young cyborg Genos, and join the
local heroic Association - let them pay their salaries, but there&#8217;s no
time to run all the time!<br>

Genre: action, mysticism, drama, thriller, horrors, psychology<br>
Episodes: 12<br>
Director: Morita Syuhei<br>
      <br>
Description: The race of ghouls has existed since time immemorial. Its
representatives are not at all against people, they even love them -
mostly raw. Fans of human flesh are outwardly indistinguishable from
us, strong, fast and tenacious - but they are few, because the ghouls
have developed strict rules for hunting and camouflage, and violators
are punished or quietly handed to fighters with evil spirits. In the
age of science, people know about the ghouls, but as they say, they are
used to. The authorities do not consider cannibals a threat, moreover,
they are considered as an ideal basis for creating super-soldiers.
Experiments have been going on for a long time ...<br>
      <br>
None of this was known by Ken Kaneki, a timid and nondescript Tokyo
freshman, hopelessly in love with the beautiful intellectual Rize, a
frequent guest at the Meeting Place cafe, where the guy works as a
waiter. I did not think Ken would soon have to become a ghoul himself,
and many acquaintances would appear in an unexpected light. The main
character will have a painful search for a new path, for he realized
that people and ghouls are alike: they just eat each other in the
literal sense, others in the figurative one. The truth of life is
cruel, it cannot be redone, and the one who does not turn away is
strong. And then somehow!<br>

      <br>
Description: At the beginning of the XXI century, an expected sensation
happened - a Japanese genius created a role-playing game with absolute
virtual reality. It is not surprising that &#8220;The Art of the Sword
Online&#8221; gained enormous popularity, and 10,000 lucky people who got the
first edition, on the appointed day and hour, found themselves in the
game world, having gathered in the City of Beginning. Then the crafty
creator, who appeared in the form of a huge shadow, and stunned
customers - it turns out, he conceived an experiment, and you can get
out of the virtual only when someone passes the game to the end! Death
in the game means death in the real world, it is necessary to work in
all seriousness - with these words the evil genius retired, and the
participants quickly realized that he was right.<br>
      <br>
Unlucky players reacted differently: who fell into despair, who began
to stray into groups, and someone decided to live on his own. In the
number of the latter, Kirito was also an orphan who lost nothing.
Moreover, being a beta tester and an experienced player, Kirito quickly
advanced, gaining fame as the Black Swordsman. On the one hand, the guy
avoided communication, not wanting to start and lose loved ones
anymore; on the other hand, it&#8217;s impossible to live in a game and be
free from people, especially from people like beautiful Asuna nicknamed
Flash! In general, so far Kirito, Asuna, other heroes and villains are
fighting on the front lines, and we believe that they will pass not
only the &#8220;Art of the Sword&#8221;, but also many more interesting games and
worlds!<br>

Description: 12-year-old Shyo Hinata saw several matches on TV - and
fell in love with volleyball. For three years, the guy worked on his
dream - and in the last year of high school he was able to assemble a
team and take it to a real tournament. And there, of course, newcomers
recruited &#8220;from the pine forest&#8221; were beaten in the very first lap, and
the terrible playmaker Tobio Kageyama, nicknamed King, gave them a
terrible defeat, almost single-handedly. The redhead fan of the ball
over the net did not give up and, eager for revenge, entered Karasuuno
High School, that is, Crow Field, where he immediately went to a
volleyball club. Guess who he met there?<br>
      <br>
This is how sworn friends-rivals began to defend the black and yellow
colors of the Ravens. Not without difficulties (no one loves the young
and the early ones), but both still became full members of the club,
although the game philosophy of the guys is different: Hinata believes
in &#8220;overcoming&#8221; and team spirit, Kageyama - in strict control and
personal skill. Perhaps due to their differences, the two young players
formed an excellent acting duet, in which both the coach and the older
comrades believed. Now, learning from each other and improving their
skills, our heroes can lead the school to new victories. What do young
volleyball players have there instead of Kosien?<br>

Description: Otaku Sakamichi Onoda just went to high school and plans
to join the anime club. In high school, Onod had no friends with whom
he could talk about anime, games, Akihabara, and other things that are
dear to the heart of every otaku. He hoped that he could do this with
new friends in the anime club, but he learned that he was disbanded. To
restore the club, he is trying to find four other students.<br>
Because of his weight, Onoda rides a mamacharia, an awkward bicycle,
which he uses mainly for short trips to pick up food or go to
Akihabara, where Onoda happens every week. The cyclist Sjunske Imaizumi
during his workout notices Onoda, who was riding up the steep road. A
freshman and cyclist-racer, Shokuti Naruko, met Onoda in Akihabara when
he bought models of Gundam for his younger brothers. Attention both
attracted mamacharia Onoda. Later it turns out that they all go to the
same school. Naruko and Imaizumi are trying to convince Onoda to join
the cycling club, but will he agree?<br>

end the hot guy vowed to personally take revenge on the murderers and
disappeared. A year later, Yoshino Takigawa came to worship the grave
of the Fuwe family - and he was embroiled in a battle between an old
friend and some cool beauty. Mahiro flew through the air and reflected
the bullets - now he found unexpected help in his search and invited
Yoshino to join. Takigawa did not refuse, because he loved Hayk,

world is shaken by disasters, people are dying, the very bond of time
is falling apart. However, who among the wizards is right - time will
tell, and Mahiro could safely say after the classic: Fiat justitia, et
pereat mundus - &#8220;let the world collapse, but justice will triumph!&#8221;<br>

      <br>
Description:<br>
Thirty thousand players from Japan and much more from around the world
were suddenly locked up in the multiplayer online role-playing game
Legend of the Ancients. On the one hand, gamers were transported to the
new world physically, the illusion of reality turned out to be almost
flawless. On the other hand, the &#8220;hitches&#8221; retained their previous
avatars and the acquired skills, the user interface and the pumping
system, and even the death in the game led only to the resurrection in
the cathedral of the nearest large city. Realizing that there is no
great goal, and no one called the price for the exit, the players began
to stray together - alone, to live and rule according to the law of the
jungle, others - to resist lawlessness.<br>
      <br>
Shiroe and Naotsugu, in the world a student and a clerk, in the game -
a cunning magician and a mighty warrior, have long known each other
from the legendary guild "Mad Tea Party". Alas, those times are gone
forever, but in the new reality one can meet old acquaintances and just
good guys with whom it will not be boring. And most importantly - in
the world of "Legends" appeared the indigenous population, who
considered the newcomers to be great and immortal heroes. Inevitably,
you want to become a sort of knight of the Round Table, beating dragons
and saving girls. Well, there are plenty of girls around, monsters and
rogues too, and for rest there are cities like the hospitable Akiba.
The main thing - to die in the game is still not worth it, it is much
more correct to live humanly!<br>
