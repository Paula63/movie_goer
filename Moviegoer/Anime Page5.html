Directed by: Date Hayato<br>
      <br>
Description:<br>
In the world of Naruto, two years flew by. Former newcomers joined the
ranks of experienced shinobi in the rank of tyunin and dzenin. The main
characters did not sit on the spot - each became a student of one of
the legendary Sannin - the three great ninja Konoha. The guy in orange
continued his studies with the wise, but eccentric Dzirayi, gradually
going back to a new level of combat skills. Sakura moved to the
assistants and trustees healer Tsunade - the new leader of Foliage
Village. Well, Sasuke, whose pride led to the expulsion from Konoha,
entered into a temporary alliance with the sinister Orochimaru, and
everyone believes that only uses the other for a time.<br>
A brief respite was over, and events once again rushed with hurricane
speed. In Konoha, the seeds of old strife, first planted by the Hokage,
sprout again. The mysterious leader Akatsuki set in motion a plan to
gain world domination. Restlessly in the Sand Village and neighboring
countries, old secrets are popping up everywhere, and it is clear that
you will have to pay bills once. The long-awaited continuation of manga
has breathed new life into the series and new hope into the hearts of
countless fans!<br>

Description:<br>
Kurosaki Ichigo is not a simple fifteen-year-old boy, because, as he
remembered himself, he could always easily communicate with spirits and
ghosts that are invisible to ordinary people. On one fateful day, he is
herself a Sinigami (death goddess) Kutiki Rukia, hunting for the Void
(an evil spirit devouring people's souls). During the battle with this
monster, Ichigo and Rukia were seriously injured, and the goddess had
to give the boy her strength to help him defeat the monster, with the
result that Ichigo himself became a shinigami! But having done this,
Rukia is losing all his power, and now he expects the newly appeared
shinigami to continue her mission to capture and destroy the Empty. So
begin the exciting adventures of Ichigo and Rukia.<br>

      <br>
Year of release: 2008<br>
Genre: comedy, mysticism, history<br>
Episodes: 24<br>
Directed by: Sinohara Tosia<br>
      <br>
Description:<br>
Mystical, with black humor and a detective slant parody comedy on the
theme of the relationship of master and servant. Alternative England of
the XIX-th century, the luxurious estate of Count Phantomhive, a
friendly company of sluggish servants, above which stands impeccable
(in every sense of the word) perfect Sebastian. The young Count Ciel
loves different games, and the abilities of the butler continually find
application. After all, these two signed an important contract, which
concerns not only the culinary talents of Sebastian.<br>
The design corresponds to the plot: from the ironically caricature
moments to the luxurious and elegant scenes - and the demonic-romantic
opening scene contrasts with the funny chibi-scenes from the ending.<br>
Kuro Shitsuji does not pretend to special mystical or psychological
depths, but at the same time remains a stupid, interesting and dynamic
series. The secrets of the correct tea, the cruelty of the Italian
mafia, the clumsiness of the novice servants and even the habits of the
relatives of the count are all in the hands of Sebastian;<br>

Description:<br>
After the monstrous earthquake that destroyed almost the whole of Tokyo
at the beginning of the 21st century, Japanese society was incurably
sick. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why 10 years later, in
2023, a huge theme park appeared on the ruins of the capital, in
combination - the country's first private prison. According to the
official version, the prisoners, instead of burdening society, are
engaged in socially useful work, and the fundraising for the revival of
Tokyo is going well. The only thing is that the public, who visits the
Country of the Death Men every day, does not see (or does not want to
see) that in &#8220;contests&#8221; and &#8220;attractions&#8221; convicts actually die. And
for the owners of life, who understand everything - if you please:
gladiator fights in the underground arena, experiments on people,
everything is like in decent houses ...<br>
      <br>
With such a business formulation, a constant influx of fresh human
material is needed. The usual eighth-grader Ganta Igarashi, whose
entire class brutally destroyed the mysterious Red Man, thundered on
the bench. The orphan of Ganta survived, without further ado, he was
declared extreme and received a death sentence, and in order to
postpone it, one has to turn in prison, participating in cruel local
games. However, having been involved, the novice found that in prison
one could live as if it were free, there would be desire and abilities.
Gradually, the hero realized that someone really wanted to put him
behind bars. And that means - it is necessary to find those who killed
friends, framed him, and to pay harshly. But who is the true puppeteer
here in Wonderland?<br>

In the kingdom of Fiore, recognized magicians are united in many
guilds, but for the young &#8220;heavenly sorceress&#8221; Lucy Heartfilia there is
only one &#8212; the legendary Fairy Tale, where she has been striving to get
to since the beginning of conscious life. This guild is famous for both
the strength and abilities of their magicians, as well as their
extravagance and endless rivalry between themselves. As a result, the
magic medicine sometimes turns out to be worse than the disease, but
such is life! That's just everyone knows that Fairy Tail is a guild
closed and small, for membership you need a surety of one of the

      <br>
Description:<br>
After the death of his adoptive father, young Shiro Emiya lived and
lived alone in a huge estate. The 16-year-old boy grew up kind,
hard-working and economic, so he was surrounded by the care and
attention of two girls at once - the younger school friend Sakura Mato
and the teacher Taiga Fujimura, formally the guardian, in fact, rather
the older sister. Everything collapsed when Shiro learned that his
hometown of Fuyuki is the arena of the magical battle for the Holy
Grail, which is repeated every few generations. But the world is
accelerating, as a result only 10 years have passed since the last war
- and the time has already come for a new one.<br>
      <br>
According to ancient laws, the &#8220;royal battle&#8221; is fought by seven
Masters-Magi, each of which causes a Servant - one of the eternal
heroes of the past or future eras. The last remaining Master receives
the Grail - the greatest treasure that fulfills any desire. There are
no rules, the goal justifies the means, yesterday's friend can be a
rival and without hesitation betray, hit in the back. Having learned
the truth, Shiro confronts a grave choice - to quit, give up the fight
or take a risk and put everything on the map - a small (as he thinks)
magic gift, a warm heart, a desperate desire to save all those who are
dear to him. But the last straw on the scales of honor and courage will
be the green eyes from the distant past, which began to shine that very
night ...<br>

Description:<br>
One day changed the life of Dr. Kenzo Temma, a genius Japanese surgeon
who arrived in Germany to work at the Eisler Memorial Hospital. On this
day, he realized that human lives are equal, and that human life itself
is worth more than the benefit that can be obtained for its salvation.
On this day, he saved a boy who was shot in the head during the murder
of his parents. After some time, three more murders occurred, and Dr.
Temma became the head of the surgical department of the hospital. In
the confusion of these days, the boy and his twin sister, who survived
the magnificent operation performed by our Aibolit, disappeared from
the hospital without a trace.<br>
      <br>
Nine years passed and the murders in Düsseldorf began again. Monster

Directed by: Yonetani Yoshitomo<br>
      <br>
Description:<br>
Soma Yukihira is a young culinary art fanatic who dreams of surpassing
his father, a famous chef. Joichiro, Soma's father, excellently cooks
simple and hearty oriental dishes, because their family restaurant is
popular with office workers, but, alas, you cannot earn on such
clients. It is difficult to experiment without money - and rare unusual
(and usually unsuccessful) experiments of the father and son are
tasting except for Yukikhir Jr.'s classmates. So, the only way left for
the guy to improve is to go to the culinary academy!<br>
      <br>
The Totsuki Culinary Academy is a legendary high school that many great
chefs, including the father of the main character, have graduated from.
The estate spirit in Totsuki is strong - but the talented simpleton can
always prove that he is worthy to stand next to the descendants of
famous dynasties. This is exactly what Soma took up, settling in the
dormitory of the Polar Star, a school shelter for not rich but
ambitious talents. The Academy encourages rivalry by arranging real
&#8220;culinary wars&#8221; - there Yukihir will show everyone, especially the
local team, the director's granddaughter Erina, whose chef's knife is
sharper, the taste is thinner, and the imagination is richer!<br>

Year of release: 2013<br>
Genre: drama, everyday<br>
Episodes:11<br>
Director: Nagai Tatsuyuki<br>
      <br>
Description:<br>
The most piercing and touching series of the spring season 2011.<br>
      <br>
A merry company of six childhood friends called themselves &#8220;super
peacemakers&#8221; broke up with the tragic death of a girl named Meiko
Homma. Dzinta Yadomi, the recognized leader of the group, began to
blame himself for the death of a girlfriend and moved away from
everyone, becoming a classic hikikomori. The rest of the guys went
their separate ways - someone entered the prestigious high school,
someone tries to live a normal life, some people even went to travel.
As has long been established, some are eager for success, others get
stuck in a swamp, and others fall to the bottom. Everything would go
well, but ... Maiko Homma, nicknamed Mamma, reappeared!<br>
      <br>
Who is Mamma - spirit, phantom, hallucination? Why nobody, except
Dzinty, does not see it and does not hear it? This is all unimportant!
The important thing is that Memma returned to her friends to fulfill
her long-held desire. What she does not remember, but one thing is
certain: for this, the "peacekeepers" must come together again. So the
hero had to get out of retreat, to break himself, to endure ridicule
and humiliation. Only the guy suffered was not for nothing - it was
soon discovered that, although none of the others could see or hear
Memma, she had all the years lived in their hearts and in their souls.
But if, by the will of the authors, the flower is a symbol of the
heroine's desire, then is it as unaware as that flower was called?<br>
