				  <h3>BlacKkKlansman</h3>
				  <p>by Spike Lee</p>
				  <p>IMDBb: 7.7/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 95%, Google Users: 92%</p>
				  <p>Genre: Drama/Crime</p>
				  <p>Plot: From visionary filmmaker Spike Lee comes the incredible true story of an American hero. It's the early 1970s, and Ron Stallworth is the first African-American detective to serve in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Determined to make a name for himself, Stallworth bravely sets out on a dangerous mission: infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan. The young detective soon recruits a more seasoned colleague, Flip Zimmerman, into the undercover investigation of a lifetime. Together, they team up to take down the extremist hate group as the organization aims to sanitize its violent rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream. Produced by the team behind the Academy-Award winning Get Out.</p>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: With this well-deserved answer to The Birth of a Nation, Spike Lee tells us a curious story using plenty of humor, conviction and style while making a necessary parallel between those events from the 1970s and the horrific resurgence of racial hatred today in Trump's America.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: BlacKkKlansman uses history to offer bitingly trenchant commentary on current events and brings out some of Spike Lee's hardest-hitting work in decades along the way.</ol>

					  <ol>Critic Review: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom adds another set piece-packed entry to the blockbuster franchise, although genuinely thrilling moments are in increasingly short supply.</ol>

				  <p>Genre: Sci-Fi/Action</p>
				  <p>Plot: Global icon Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure Rampage, directed by Brad Peyton. Johnson stars as primatologist Davis Okoye, a man who keeps people at a distance but shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, incredibly rare albino silverback gorilla who has been in his care since he rescued the young orphan from poachers. But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size. To make matters worse, it's soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals. As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with discredited geneticist Kate Caldwell to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.</p>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: A lot better than expected. And on IMAX 3D this was a winner. I hate trailers, and tried to watch the trailer after I watched the movie.. well, it shows EVERYTHING! If you want to see the movie without knowing what's going to happen, do NOT see the trailer. I'm not sure why the trailers are so long and so revealing. They ruin everything for me. And in cinemas I have to watch a whole bunch of them!</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Rampage isn't as fun as its source material, but the movie's sheer button-mashing abandon might satisfy audiences in the mood for a brainless blockbuster.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: I'm a fan of Burnham's, so I expected a lot from this film, and he did not disappoint. Apart from a few after school special tropes in the beginning, Burnham and Fisher really capture the realism of middle schools, while hitting a lot of subtle nuances that many media portrayals of schools miss. The laughs and the cringes are plenty and welcome, as are the heartfelt moments and moments of self-discovery. I look forward to more Bo Burnham written and directed films after this great debut.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Eighth Grade takes a look at its titular time period that offers a rare and resounding ring of truth while heralding breakthroughs for writer-director Bo Burnham and captivating star Elsie Fisher.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: Remember that super colossal huge shark movie that changed everything about watching summer films? No, not that one. And not that other one. Man, there's been a lot of shark movies! The first one. Yeah, that's the one. Jaws. Well this movie takes your money and asks you the very same question I just asked you. Takes your money. Well do you remember? Do ya, punk? Well, this ain't that movie. But it does remind you of it.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  The Meg sets audiences up for a good old-fashioned B-movie creature feature, but lacks the genre thrills or the cheesy bite  to make it worth diving in.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: Feeney (the persuasive, unexpectedly Australian James Frecheville) plays an Irish Ranger who returns from wars in Afghanistan to find his family caught in the cogs of the developing holocaust. Heaving around a head like an Easter Island statue decorated with weeds, Feeney soon encounters even worse outrages and, setting aside ideas of emigration, vows to pursue a war against the administrators and colonialist bandits. This is a must see.</ol>
