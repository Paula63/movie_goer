Description:<br>
The 18-year-old Sora and the 11-year-old Shiro are half-brothers and
sister, complete recluses and gamers. When two loneliness met, the
indestructible union &#8220;Empty Space&#8221; was born, terrifying of all Eastern
gamers. Although in public the children are shaking and korezhit not
childishly, on the Web, baby Shiro is a genius of logic, and Sora is a
monster of psychology who cannot be held. Alas, worthy opponents soon
ended, because Shiro was so happy about the chess game, where the
master's handwriting was visible from the first moves. Having won at
the limit of strength, the heroes received an interesting offer - to
move to another world, where their talents will understand and
appreciate!<br>
      <br>
Why not? In our world of Sora and Shiro, nothing holds, and the Ten
Commandments, the essence of which boils down to one, rule the Disborn
world of joy: all violence and cruelty, all disagreements are solved in
a fair game. In the game world there are 16 races, of which the human
is considered the weakest and mediocre. But after all, the miracle guys
are already here, in their hands, the crown of Elliki - the only
country of people, and we believe that the successes of Sora and Ciro

unite all the races of Disboard - and then they will be able to
challenge the god Tet - his, by the way, old acquaintance. Only, if you
think about whether to do it?<br>

Description: Instead of progress, humanity was thrown back by the
appearance of the race of giants. The huge humanoids did not possess
either speech or intelligence, but at the same time they devoured
people like chips, the usual weapons of the level of the 19th century
turned out to be powerless. The remnants of the kind of human
intervention survive only behind the cyclopean walls, which triggered
the last fields, cities and villages with a triple ring. The lull
lasted for a hundred years, during which time people calmed down, the
army was reduced, and the city guard turned into parasites. Only the
Intelligence Corps maintained its combat capability - but who needs
suicides, who constantly risk their lives outside the walls, when you
can safely sit behind a stone fence?<br>
      <br>
Alas, all good ends. A terrifying colossus crushed the outer wall of
the Maria, and the giants destroyed one of the cities. The mother of
the young Ehren died, his father disappeared, and the boy, seething
with a thirst for revenge, along with his adopted sister Mikasa entered
the Corps, whose elite fighters can beat the giants one-on-one. To
master the system of cables, winches and gas boosters is not easy, but
only such a technique helps to make crazy jumps and hit monsters in the
back of the head - the only weak spot. It is necessary to learn
quickly, because there is a war, and the actions of the enemy are
becoming more aggressive - as if someone&#8217;s alien intelligence is behind
the brainless mountains of flesh. Or ... not so alien? Etna and his
friends among fights and battles you can open a lot of frightening
secrets!<br>

Description: 14-year-old Yukiteru Amano lived as a loner, without much
parental attention, without touching anyone and considering himself
only an observer of the surrounding world. And what about the observer
without a travel log, or at least a diary? That Yukki and led him
regularly on your mobile phone, earning in the school a reputation as a
harmless fool. But the opinion of those around the hero didn&#8217;t care,
for he communicated only with an imaginary friend Deus, and by
profession - the god of our Universe. God loved a simple Japanese guy
and often shared wise thoughts with him. Yes, but in vain Amano once
blurted out that he was bored!<br>
      <br>
Search and find! As a result, the phone of a poor schoolchild gained
the ability to predict events and turned into a &#8220;diary of the future&#8221;,
while the main character himself became a member of the &#8220;royal battle&#8221;.
According to Deus, twelve owners of the &#8220;diaries&#8221; should meet and
destroy each other in 90 days, so that only one will remain - he will
replace the god in the post, becoming the new Creator. Of course, it is
easier to consider such a sick fantasy - but the type that came to kill
Amano thought differently. The guy was saved only with the help of a
pretty classmate Yuno - as it turned out, also a participant in the
game! Come on, Yukkah, hope for Deusa, but don't make it yourself!<br>

Description: Ten years ago, the world has changed: some people signed
the "Contract" with unknown force and acquired special abilities -
along with the need to pay under this contract. In addition, there were
mediums - obedient "dolls" without memory and personality. In Tokyo, a
paranormal zone was formed, which was called the "Gate of Hell" and
surrounded by a protective wall. Rezvedsluzhby began hunting for
contractors, trying to attract them to their side or destroy.<br>
      <br>
Hey, nicknamed the Black God of Death, together with his team performs
the tasks of a mysterious Organization. He is able to manage
electricity, which allows him to destroy other contractors. But Haye's
main opponent is the past, in which people close to him remained.<br>
      <br>
Despite the fantastic entourage, dynamism and detective story, filled
with investigations and chases, this series develops according to the
laws of the blues, which contributes to the soundtrack Yoko Kanno. The
most important thing here is the feelings and desires of the
characters, the search for humanity and their place in the world. Vivid
colors and expressive character design also bring it closer to the noir
genre.<br>

Description: The conflict between Earth and the Versian Empire entered
a protracted phase. In fact, confrontation is not necessary for both
sides, but the fire of war inflates part of the imperial aristocracy,
intoxicated by its power and blood feud for the losses suffered
earlier. The leader of the &#8220;hawks,&#8221; Count Sazbaum, even enlisted the
support of the crown princess Asseil, who he personally saved from the
clutches of earthly savages, who almost killed the peace ambassador.
Encouraged by this success, the small, but perfectly armed, armies of
the Empire crowd earthlings on all fronts.<br>
      <br>
In the meantime, the &#8220;earth savages&#8221; were able to pick up the key to
the Aldnoi - the technology of the Forerunners, which until then had
provided the enemy with an overwhelming military advantage. Good luck
accompanied the group Inakho Kaizuki, who accompanied the princess
Asseil on her short journey on Earth. Inakho knows that his girlfriend
was wounded and captured by the Versians, but now with the sermons of
the war comes the impostor. Where is the real princess? The only thing

Description: What if your right hand healed with your life? 16-year-old
Shin-ichi Izumi almost lost his mind, but stopped on time. In the hand
of a simple Japanese schoolboy settled a parasite - from an alien race
that flew to enslave humanity. Only normal parasites immediately erupt
the brain through the ears and nose, and Sina saved the headphones and
light sleep, and that formed an unusual partnership. After talking with
his partner, who simply called Right, the guy worked out a simple rule
- he eats for two, and his partner helps solve problems, good Izumi&#8217;s
right hand can now work wonders on the envy of karate masters!<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, other parasites who successfully captured the bodies of the
victims decided to deal with Shin-ichi, because he knows their secret,
while the aliens themselves are rather weak for an open war.
Fortunately or not, it turned out that the Right One is a terrible
egoist: he is concerned about his own existence much more than the
goals of the whole race, and the uninvited guest is ready to defend his
master. Thus began the life of another secret hero, in which Sin must
fight the alien evil, hiding from people, losing loved ones. How much
the main character has to carry his heavy cross, nobody knows,
including himself. In general, for all of humanity no parasites are
enough!<br>

Description: Akihabara is an interesting place where a variety of
people live - from slightly out of phase to sick people. Such a company
gathered in the &#8220;Laboratory of problems of time&#8221;, which is above the
shop of old TVs. It is headed by the "real wild", 18-year-old Rintaro
Okabe, a mad scientist and a fighter with a global conspiracy. In a
serious matter, it is impossible without a hacker - here he is, Itaru
Hasid, of course, a fat man and a true otaku. Good fairy laboratories -
Mayuri Siina, a childhood friend of Rintaro, a waitress of a maid cafe
and a cosplay fan, and the scientific power of the brigade sharply

intellectual adventures and simple human warmth.<br>

Of course, the guys managed to build a time machine from the microwave
