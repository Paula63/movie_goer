				  by Frank Darabont<br>
				  IMDBb: 8.4/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 81%, Google Users: 94%<br>
				  Genre: Post-Apocalyptic/Horror<br>
				  Description: Based on the comic book series written by Robert Kirkman, this gritty drama portrays life in the months and years that follow a zombie apocalypse. Led by former police officer Rick Grimes, his family and a group of other survivors find themselves constantly on the move in search of a safe and secure home. But the pressure each day to stay alive sends many in the group to the deepest depths of human cruelty, and Rick discovers that the overwhelming fear of the survivors can be more deadly than the zombies walking among them. <br>

				  Comment Reviews on Season 9
				  <ol>User Review: Nine seasons in, The Walking Dead feels more alive than ever, with heightened tension and a refreshed pace that rejuvenates this long-running franchise.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review:The world of The Walking Dead is still a scary and dangerous place. Characters will still die and characters will still show their horrific true colors, but characters will also laugh, and love and, gosh darnit, they&rsquo;ll live this season. With Rick at relative peace as his final episodes approach though Lincoln may be directing some episodes! it&rsquo;s intriguing to watch another member of his group go dark.</ol></div>

				  Description: An eccentric yet compassionate extraterrestrial Time Lord zips through time and space to solve problems and battle injustice across the universe, traveling via the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions in Space), which is his old and occasionally unreliable spaceship that resembles a blue police phone box (but changes its appearance depending on its surroundings) and is much, much larger inside than outside.<br>

				  <ol>User Review: Carried by Jodie Whittaker's boundless energy and charm, Doctor Who's latest regeneration manages to feel fresh well into the show's 55-year tenure.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: The premiere episode here, The Woman Who Fell to Earth, reminded me, more than anything, of The X-Files,when it was really good. It takes you back to the days when Doctor Who was a fun sci-fi procedural.[The alien] resembles some gleaming villain out of a Marvel movie, which makes his blokey name, Tim Shaw, even more incongruously funny. This is Doctor Who at its best nerdy and chilling and quick with a joke. And, most significantly of all, generous of spirit, a quality that simply shimmers off Whittaker.</ol></div>

				  <ol>Critic Review: House of Cards folds slightly under the weight of its labyrinthian ending thankfully Robin Wright's commanding performance is more than enough to keep it standing strong.</ol></div>

				  by Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br>
				  IMDBb: 8.5/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 92%, Google Users: 97%<br>
				  Genre: Animated-comedy/Drama<br>
				  Description: A humanoid horse, BoJack Horseman lost in a sea of self-loathing and booze decides it's time for a comeback. Once the star of a '90s sitcom, in which he was the adoptive father of three orphaned kids (two girls and a boy). The show was the hottest thing around, then suddenly, was canceled. Now 18 years later, BoJack wants to regain his dignity. With the aid of a human sidekick and a feline ex-girlfriend who is his agent, he sets out to make it happen. But Hollywood is vastly different from those days, and getting used to stuff like Twitter may take some time. This first animated series from Netflix with plenty of references to sex, drugs and alcohol is not for the little ones.<br>
