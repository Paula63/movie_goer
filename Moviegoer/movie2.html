				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Forceful, cringe-worthy CGI, dialogue and humor, Venom needs more than just its witty, charming chemistry from Hardy and his symbiotic counterpart to save what seems to be just another sub-par entry in Sony's attempt to salvage what universe it has or is trying to create.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Venom's first standalone movie turns out to be like the comics character in all the wrong ways chaotic, noisy, and in desperate need of a stronger attachment to Spider-Man.</ol>

While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music.

					  <ol>User Review: One of the best movies of the year! The performances are all excellent. The music surpasses what I had imagined. Brings back the eighties superbly. The last 15 to 20 brought tears to many in the showing I was at. Don't miss it.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: There's a scene in "Bohemian Rhapsody" I keep coming back to, because it's symbolic of the film's problems, not just with its presentation of Queen, but of Freddie Mercury, the legendary lead singer and the greatest frontman of all time.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: There is a big difference between paying tribute and recycling, and so it shocks me that, after 40 years of crappy sequels and more slashers, people still don't get what made the original film so good, with this being just another unoriginal bundle of cliche&rsquo;s full of dumb characters.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Halloween largely wipes the slate clean after decades of disappointing sequels, ignoring increasingly elaborate mythology in favor of basic yet still effective ingredients.</ol>

				  <p>Genre: Drama/Sci-Fi</p>

Written by Academy Award winner Josh Singer (Spotlight), the drama is produced by Wyck Godfrey & Marty Bowen (The Twilight Saga, The Fault in Our Stars) through their Temple Hill Entertainment banner, alongside Chazelle and Gosling.

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Relying on a beautiful score, an amazing technology and an intelligent direction that emphasizes the character's lack of anything to anchor him in his life, this is a poignant character study about a man who wants to isolate himself not only from his family but from the rest of the world.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: First Man uses a personal focus to fuel a look back at a pivotal moment in human history and takes audiences on a soaring dramatic journey along the way.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: I never want to wet my feet, though I was on the shores. Intentionally ignored such genre movies for a long time. Finally 96., This wave just dragged me deep and swallowed me into it. No kisses,No lusty scenes,No double meanings,No punch dialogues,No fight sequence,No drama,No alcohol, Only love! #96Movie demolishes all the superstitious scenes in Tamil cinema! Like a time machine, it makes everyone to go back to his/her first love!</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: There is a lot to fall in love with 96, a wistful romantic film about a past romance, like Autograph and Premam. But what sets Prem Kumar's film apart from the others is that it gives equal importance to the romance of its female lead. It does begin as the story of its male lead, Ram (Vijay Sethupathi), a travel photographer.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: The director does choose with this film to present in a non-linear way. Often times it does show flashbacks. That might not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it works. I think it helps to delve into David's mind and understand where he's coming from. He probably is thinking "Where did I go wrong?" I also felt the director did a good job of establishing shots to remind you of a happier time without using flashbacks. For instance there is a scene where Nic is playing with his younger siblings in the sprinkler and then later (after another heartbreaking scene of Nic fleeing) there is a shot of the empty backyard with the sprinkler coming on.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  Beautiful Boy sees Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell delivering showcase work that's often powerful enough to make up for the story's muted emotional impact.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: Pretty much the definition of an okay movie. It's good for some giggles and action sequences, but not too much else. I can't say I am a huge fan of the Ant-Man series so far, the big appeal of this film was any answers to the ending of Avengers: Infinity War, and there really isn't much to that either. LIke the first Ant-Man, I probably won't remember this film when the third installment rolls around.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and The Wasp offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: A magnificent movie, captivating performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. The ultimate shock was how brilliant Lady Gaga was, we knew she could sing, but didn't have any idea just how far her acting talent stretches! After watching that I can tell you it stretches far enough to earn her some Oscar gold. The movie is outstanding, the music is annoyingly perfect, the cast is great and everything shouts Oscar worthy movie. Ten out of ten!</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: With appealing leads, deft direction, and an affecting love story, A Star Is Born is a remake done right and a reminder that some stories can be just as effective in the retelling.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The directing is great, John Cho puts on the best performance of his career, but the story steals the show. Packed with suspense, surprises, heart and constant intrigue throughout, the script sets this movie apart from the rest. It's so engrossing that you forget the entire film is presented on phone and laptop screens, a unique feature that Chaganty pulls of successfully.</ol>
