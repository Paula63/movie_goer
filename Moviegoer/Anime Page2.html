      <br>
Description:<br>
After a dramatic match in the World Cup finals, Goro Shigeno received
wide acclaim and made it to Major League Baseball - America's premier
baseball league. The audience, reporters, and the owner of the Indiana
Hornets Club place great hopes on a 19-year-old pitcher, but
experienced players, including new teammates, are not in a hurry with
the assessments - they saw the young and the early players in big
sports in abundance. Goro himself, in spite of a cheerful look, is in
fact in a deep crisis. The cause of his life, the rivalry with Joe
Gibson Sr., is over, and now the guy is moving forward by inertia, not
understanding what to strive for.<br>
      <br>
For each action, a reason is needed, after achieving some goals, you
need to set others. It&#8217;s hard for a guy who is far from family and
friends. The young talent has yet to realize that the strength for
self-affirmation in the best world league and rivalry with the same
young baseball genius Gibson Junior should be sought not in superficial
bravado and arrogance, but in the depths of his own soul. Of course,
understanding will come with experience - no wonder that in the East
they say: &#8220;The older, the better.&#8221; Most importantly, Goro has the
necessary qualities. To become a great player, you need only time.
Well, the appearance of Shimizu-chan clearly does not hurt!<br>

Description:<br>
Kyoko Mogami from childhood loved the fairy tale about Cinderella.
Therefore, she firmly knows that at the beginning of the fairy tale,
the heroine needs to work a lot, walk messily and hope for the best -
then at the end she will have fabulous outfits, a series of balls and a
wedding with the prince.<br>
      <br>
The prince is already there - this is Kyoko's former classmate,
handsome Shou Fuwa, who went to Tokyo to become a pop star. Kyoko went
to the capital with him. While Syo makes her way into show business,
she cooks, erase and works two jobs to pay for an expensive apartment.
Kyoko does not grumble, because Cinderella should behave. But then she
suddenly finds out that her handsome prince appreciates Kyoko only as a
servant - a trouble-free, albeit rather tedious, housemaid. That he
took her to the capital only for housekeeping, and Kyoko&#8217;s loyalty and
tenderness are completely indifferent to him and even ridiculous.<br>
      <br>
Thus ended the &#8220;fabulous&#8221; period of Kyoko&#8217;s life. Now she understood
that she would be guided by holy revenge: she would prove to the
mean-spirited Syo, that his &#8220;boring maid&#8221; was a real star, and that he
was the last idiot who had neglected her !!! It is said - done: Kyoko
is sent to storm the agency for the promotion of young talents (of
course, the one that competes with the agency of her former prince) ...<br>

Country boy Tatsumi, along with his childhood friends, went to conquer
the capital to help his native village. Alas, the heart of the
glittering Empire was rotted long ago, a cruel and greedy minister
ruled over the country on a throne, the bread places were sold, the
guards were busy with extortion, not law enforcement. Therefore, the
city is terrorized by the gang of "Night Raid", which attacked the
family of aristocrats who sheltered Tatsumi. Here are just the cute
owners were sadists, luring naive provincials, and the hero's friends
ended up in their torture basement. Tatsumi, with his own hands, took
revenge on the villains, and there was no further way back &#8212; only to
the gang!<br>
      <br>
New acquaintances turned out to be not criminals, but a fighting
detachment of revolutionaries, "punishing the sword" of the growing
army of freedom fighters. The other mission of &#8220;Tale&#8221; is the collection
of money and the extraction of Teigu, ancient artifacts in the form of
weapons, armor or power abilities. All the militants of the group have
such weapons - from the former officer Bulat to the baby Mine, and the
regime's chain dogs, eager to destroy the "raiders", own it. Tatsumi,
of course, imbued with ideas of freedom, but honestly admitted that his
current level is still weak. As the classic said, it is necessary to
&#8220;learn military affairs in a real way,&#8221; and then there are few of their
beauties, and you will have to fight back from the loving blue-haired
generals Esdeath!<br>

Description:<br>
Good school grades - a prestigious university - a large corporation:
this is the life plan of the majority of Japanese boys and girls. But
in each generation there are stubborn people who are ready to reject a
bird in their hands for the sake of the opportunity to preserve their
individuality and do their favorite thing. Such are the young artist
Moritaka Mashiro and the beginning writer Akito Takagi, who are still
finishing high school, but have already made a difficult decision to
devote their lives to creating manga, a unique phenomenon of Japanese
culture.<br>
      <br>
The heroes of the series are fans of manga, laureates of youth contests
and are familiar with the realities of the &#8220;adult&#8221; show business, where
units make their way up. But when else to risk, if not in 16 years? And
here, Moritaka, prone to reflection, suddenly finds out that his
favorite and classmate, Miho Azuki, wants to be an actress-seiyu, that
is, to work on an "adjacent specialty." Being at the mercy of euphoria,
the guy immediately offers the girl two things: to play sometime in the
anime in their manga and ... marry him. The most interesting thing is
that Adzuki agrees to do both - but in the same strict sequence. Now
the creative duo will have to put everything on the map - hard work,
talent, potential career - and firmly believe in yourself and your
luck. If you don&#8217;t try, you don&#8217;t know, Dragonball wasn&#8217;t built right
away either!<br>
