Description: Kosei Arima was a child prodigy who won many competitions
from an early age. Of course, experts noted that in style the kid was
more a technician than a virtuoso, and even gave him the nickname
"metronome", but the judges did not consider this a disadvantage. Alas,
at 11 years old Arima lost his mother - the only teacher and mentor -
and stopped hearing his game. The pain of loss blocked his path to the
piano, and Kosei seemed frozen in time, talking for two years only with
childhood friends Tsubaki and Ryota. In an effort to stir up the guy,
Tsubaki pulled him on a &#8220;double date&#8221; - this is where it all began!<br>
      <br>
The missing participant was the golden-haired Kaori Miyadzono,
extremely impulsive and energetic. Because of her, the whole company
turned out to be in a concert hall, where Kaori participated in a
violin competition, instead of cinema or shopping. Kosei understood
from the very first notes (he could listen to someone else's game) that
in music a girl is his antipode: instead of the phenomenally exact
following of the score, she plays as you please! Well, the opposites
converge, and after a couple of days of dating, Miyadzono firmly took
matters into her own hands and offered Arime to accompany her at the
second stage of the competition. And there after all, and before
returning to the scene close!<br>

Description: Sotoba village, lost in the Japanese wilderness, and at
the end of the 20th century does not surrender to the advancing
civilization. Yes, the old people are leaving, and some of the young,
like Megumi Shimizu, a tenth-grader, dream to flee to the metropolis
right after school. But there are others - for example, 32-year-old
Toshio Ozaki returned to his homeland and headed the village clinic,
and the Natsuno family generally moved from the city closer to nature.
Life in the outback flows quietly and serenely, but the emergence of
the mysterious inhabitants of the newly built "master" house on the
hill shook the neighborhood and gave food for gossip to everyone - from
the sharpened glamor of Shimizu to the last village sable. That's just
for the interesting news came to news where the worst ...<br>
      <br>
In the midst of the August heat, in the days long established for
holidays and divination, people are beginning to die in the village.
The first victim was the overly curious Megumi, followed by others. The
investigation has shown that the causes of mass deaths are not at all
in a mysterious epidemic, the matter is much more complicated ... and
worse. More and more often gloomy eyes are turning to the house on the
hill, fear is penetrating deeper and deeper into the souls. Dr. Ozaki
and other locals who have not lost their courage pledge themselves to
understand the secret and go to the end. Their fate will be decided by
the magnificent fantasy of the author of "The Twelve Kingdoms"!<br>

Description: It became boring for the gods, and they descended into the
world, retaining for themselves the minimum of attributes of divinity &#8212;
immortality, foresight, and a little bit of strength to support their
followers. The city of Orario, where stands a huge donjon, works for
adventurers of various races, who gather in clans headed by numerous
gods. A separate force in the city is the Guild - it is a bank, and an
exchange bureau, and a stock exchange. The gods have forever got rid of
boredom: after all, besides leading the clan, you can develop business,
create intrigues, select other people's human toys - in general, lead a
normal full-fledged life.<br>
      <br>
The clan of Hestia, alas, is not large - the goddess herself, who took
the form of a young maiden, and young Bell, a blonde with red eyes.
Once Bell went on adventurers to run through the levels, beat the
monsters and meet the girls - and reached the goal, falling deeply in
love with Aiz, the &#8220;princess of swords&#8221; from the Loki clan. So far, the
hero for his darling is clearly weak, but Bell has a reason to develop,
Hestia is jealous, Aiz herself has to shrug, and half of the city
actively cheers for the youth. This is still nothing, but when the
insidious love goddess Freya intervenes in the matter - it becomes
really interesting!<br>

Description:<br>
In Japanese youth basketball, everyone knows Teiko High School, whose
club is not only famous for its traditions, but also for the
magnificent Dream Team, the Wonder Generation, the five geniuses who
have won everything they can in recent years. The time has come - and
the five young talents dispersed in five senior schools - of course,
equally prestigious in terms of sports. But only a few knew that, in
addition to the renowned five in the team, Teiko was also the sixth, a
little less than the player, whose name and merit for some reason
remained in the shadows ...<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, the main character, Tetsuya Kuroko, enters Seyrin High
School and enrolls in a local club. Seirin is a new school, but her
team has already managed to go to the finals of the national
tournament. And then newcomers came to the club, one of whom, by the
name of Taiga Kagami, was learning the game in America - the Holy Land
of basketball. But what is it? Odd-looking Kuroko, in his words, was
not only listed on Teiko&#8217;s stellar team, but also regularly went to the
site with a &#8220;generation of miracles&#8221;? Is the guy really telling the
truth, and if so, what is his talent, which neither experienced players
nor the girl coach Riko Ida can see yet? The answer is simple -
Kuroko's game will soon be appreciated not only by today's comrades and
the strongest high schools in Japan, but also by us, the audience of
the series!<br>

Description:<br>
Rota Sakamoto - 22-year-old unemployed, a world-class player in the
popular team boevku "kaboom!". The fact that he is at the same time
sitting on his mother's neck does not bother the guy, his thoughts are
entirely in the virtual world, where he is cool, merciless and
irresistible. Only in our time, virtual reality is far away - Ryota was
convinced of this on his own skin, waking up in the jungle, well
beaten, with an alien bag and full of confusion in his head. In
general, it turned out that someone's evil will threw a few dozen
players onto an uninhabited island and invited them to fight in
&#8220;Babakh!&#8221; Live and in a big way. Without weapons, without armor - only
hand bombs, their own bodies and civilian clothes. As they say -
natural selection!<br>
      <br>
But it&#8217;s difficult to embarrass a real player in a royal battle,
especially when his own life is at stake. So soon Rota threw
intellectuals snot and prepared as the not so distant ancestors, live
by the principle "either you or you." The main thing is to survive, and
there it is already possible to philosophize about the meaning of being
and to argue with his cordial friend Khimiko to the fullest extent -
why did they get such a fate? As the saying goes: do not sin - do not
repent, do not repent - not be saved. And on the island you can see new
places, enjoy the beautiful nature, meet lots of interesting people ...
and kill them!<br>

A terrible disease that turns people into zombies, broke free, and the
world collapsed overnight. The trouble crept softly and to the private
academy of Fujimi, only a few schoolchildren and teachers were able to
recognize it and flee from the crowd of the living dead. The roads of
the survivors diverged. In the center of the plot is the fate of a
cramped group, whose unwitting leader, 17-year-old Takashi Komuro, is
ready to do anything to save his childhood friend Ray Miyamoto. On the
way to the will, they are joined by other students &#8212; the president of
the kendo club, Saeko Busuzima, a fan of Kota Hirano&#8217;s weapons, and the

friends and who is ready to push the falling one; who just wants to

The heroes will have to go through an accelerated course of the harsh
science of survival in order to find loved ones and not lose hope. We
must live on, and hope will always be!<br>

the baby who was eating the watermelons in his carriage. Aladdin, a

heads, and they would have survived, left the villains, and grabbed the
beauty for the company!<br>

themselves, working hand in hand with their rival friends, cunning
thieves and cunning rulers. However, Aladdin, Ali Baba, and even

astonished. There are still a lot of donjons, there are even more
countries and seas in the world of the series, where there is a place
to talk with genies, enter politics and find new secrets and wonders.
In the end, Scheherazade was not in this world, and no one set the time
frame for the heroes!<br>
