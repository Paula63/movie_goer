Described as "a man everyone likes, but no one respects," Franklin has seen men die under his leadership on previous expeditions, and now he would like to retire with honors by discovering the Northwest Passage. Guiding the HMS Erebus into uncharted territory, Franklin's most perilous journey yet pushes his crew to the brink of extinction. Frozen, isolated and stuck at the end of the earth, the men have been put in horrible danger by their commander's Victorian hubris. A struggle to survive ignites infighting, and Franklin must try to undo the damage he has caused.<br>

				  <ol>User Review: Because viewers again know someone is dead and again don't know how, whether or not the episodes recreate the same morbid puzzle as before could define whether or not "This Is Us" learns from its past and improves as a whole. pay off, and feelings geyser up in surprising places.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review:It has a strong sense of its identity, why people are tuning in, and it delivers that without pandering or patronizing. That&rsquo;s a hard thing to do, and, for all the sledgehammer emotional twists the show is known for, proves it delicately.</ol></div>

				  <ol>Critic Review:Charming, realistic, and focused on underrepresented communities, On My Block is the respite from stylized teen dramas you didn't know you needed.

				  <ol>User Review: If the cinematic Ryans of the 1990s couldn't fully sell his incompetence, Krasinski's version of the character makes a more convincing case that it's his brains, not his combat skills, that set him apart as an American hero..</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: Showrunners Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland have perfectly reimagined Ryan for modern audiences. They certainly couldn&rsquo;t have found a better actor to play him.</ol></div>

				  <ol>User Review: My hope that "Ozark" would get its sea legs in season two was for naught. Most of what was good in season one remains good, most importantly Linney, but then there are a few excruciating characters and subplots this time around.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: Engaging and entertaining if not particularly challenging Ozark's descent into darker waters is kept afloat by another superb turn from Laura Linney.</ol></div>

				  Genre: Sitcom<br>
				  Description: Explore life, death and everything in between through the relatable, hilarious and brutally honest lens of the working-class Conner household, which is located in the drab, fictional exurb of Langford, Ill.

				  <ol>Critic Review: Roseanne's return finds the show's classic format, original cast, and timely humor intact, even if the latest batch of episodes suffers from sporadically uneven execution.</ol></div>

				  <ol>User Review: And after five years, the show has figured out just how to make sure all of those elements work together - just like the oddball cops of the 99th precinct, who started off as co-workers and now feel like a family.</ol>
				  <ol>Critic Review: This show is really funny. I watched all five seasons this summer and I cannot wait for season six. The character development throughout each season is well done and story lines are not dragged out too long. The comedy is done tastefully. Unlike other comedy shows Brooklyn Nine-nine also touches on some hard hitting topics relevant to today's world. I would recommend watching this show and the episodes are only 20 minutes long.</ol></div>

And there's also the usual teenage romance issues to deal with. Luke, the de facto ringleader of the AV club, falls for Kate, the principal's daughter, but she doesn't necessarily reciprocate the romantic feelings Luke has for her and is dealing with her own issues.<br>
