								Critic Review: In the clearest sense of the term The Matrix is a classic, not only a great movie, but a film that simultaneously redefined its own medium. Forever. (Ian Nathan, Empire)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: The greatest film ever made! The dialogue requires your attention. the cinematography differentiates the 'real world' from the simulated world which is brilliantly subtle. Solid computer programming logic goes hand in hand with the story.

								Critic Review: A huge, bloody and sprawling epic, "Braveheart" is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didn't essentially deliver. (Brian Lowry, Variety)

								Critic Review: Marco Tullio Giordana's "The Best of Youth" is an impassioned epic that sweeps up its characters in nearly 40 years of human drama and social history, intertwining the two with a master seamstress' delicacy. A rousing success at Cannes, "Youth" will be served at many of the prestigious fall festivals, with a shot at specialized commercial runs. (Variety)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: I can only sum up two points: it is an excellent yet easy-going overview of recent Italian history, and a truly moving, in an umbonal and not stereotypical, way, movie about the value of friendship, closeness, family. This film makes you want to live, to cherish the people you love and to be aware of the consequences of your acts.

								Critic Review: This classic tale of mob life in New York City is a stunning, vivid look at the ugliness and depravity of a subculture that's been glamorized, sanitized, and romanticized in countless other films. (Common Sense Media)  
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: One word: priceless. If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas": it'd be priceless. A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book "Wiseguy").
