								Critic Review: Teenage alienation? Check. Angst? Check. Ennui? (Even though we didn't even really know what that was in 1985?) Check. (Adam R. Holz, Plugged In)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: I would most certainly recommend it. Although many parts of it are predictable and extreme caricatures of social and economic strata, I loved the way that all the characters, including the teacher were shaken, and stirred, and realised that they had more in common than they had initially concluded.

								Critic Review: War Horse is bold, exquisite family filmmaking in the grandest Hollywood tradition. Be warned: whether you're a hippophilic or not, it's a four-hankie moviegoing experience. (Ian Freer, Empire)
							</p>
							<p>
								Audience Review: You can basically look at this as both Spielberg's epic salute to John Ford, as well as his Barry Lyndon. Like the Kubrick film, this is a gorgeous piece of work, with each shot looking like something straight out of a painting. This is easily some of the best cinematography from any of Spielberg's films.
