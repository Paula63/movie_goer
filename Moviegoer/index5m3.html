								Critic Review: "Sunset Boulevard" is a backstage melodrama using a filmland, instead of a legit, locale. Because it is tied in with a pseudo-expose of Hollywood, the peek behind the scenes undoubtedly will fascinate a considerable slice of the theatre-going public, lured to the ticket window by all the drumbeating Paramount calculates to put behind it. B.O.-wise, the ballyhoo possibilities are strong, and returns will reflect the selling. (Variety, William Brogdon)

								Audience Review: Subtle, savage and insightful but with such a big heart it is as moving as it is informative about the value of making art that moves.
