				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Despite the nice scene transitions, the two parallel storylines are not always put together in an organic way, but while Ol Parker's direction is not so en pointe either, this uplifting sequel is notably superior to the awful first movie in about everything: singing, acting and heart.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again doubles down on just about everything fans loved about the original and my my, how can fans resist it?</ol>

				  <p>IMDb: 6.3/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 57%, Google Users: 85%</p>
				  <p>Genre: Drama/Mystery</p>
				  <p>Plot: Insurance salesman Michael is on his daily commute home, which quickly becomes anything but routine. After being contacted by a mysterious stranger, Michael is forced to uncover the identity of a hidden passenger on the train before the last stop. As he works against the clock to solve the puzzle, he realizes a deadly plan is unfolding, and he is unwittingly caught up in a criminal conspiracy that carries life and death stakes for everyone on the train.</p>

				  <p>Cast: Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill</p>
				  <p>Producers: Andrew Rona, Alex Heinemen</p>
				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Again Neeson is a man in a desperate situation who soon teaches his tormentors that he is not to be messed with. His character is somewhat more realistic than in some of the similar thrillers before, but several parts of the film require quite some suspension of disbelief. The film uses its limited setting well enough for things not to get boring, of course even the trailer had to give away that there is a crash in the end. Some of the supposed twists are not particularly surprising, but the film is entertaining enough not to make you regret being along for the ride.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: The Commuter's cast is better than its workmanlike script which helps make this reasonably diverting Liam Neeson action thriller worth the price of a matinee ticket or rental, if not a full-price ticket.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: On it's own this may be a decent movie. But if you watched Narcos before this movie, it only seems like a hasty summary of the series, told from the viewpoint of one of the less interesting characters. This, combined with the fact that it should have been in Spanish, and the annoying voice over, makes it a pain to watch. One upside: Javier Bardem is actually good as Pablo!</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Loving Pablo bungles its seemingly cinematic real-life story and a pair of talented stars in producing a lurid biopic that adds nothing to the Escobar subgenre.</ol>

Her husband, Ron, is loving and works hard, but remains clueless about the demands that motherhood puts on his wife.

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Tully makes it obvious that it isn't trying to sugarcoat the realities of motherhood. In fact, the film is so realistic, mothers might feel it hits too close to home. It's admirable, however, and terrific director Jason Reitman, who delivered the superior and more balanced films Juno and Up in the Air, delivers this intimate but very straight-minded drama with a muted sensibility. Mackenzie Davis and Charlize Theron shine, however, the film unravels a bit when it throws in a rather underdeveloped twist that takes a turn for the bitter. It ends the film in a rather sour note, and upon further thought reflects the themes of the film rather messily. Still, Tully will mean a lot to mothers and to those who ever have underestimated the difficulty of being one. </ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review:  Tully delves into the modern parenthood experience with an admirably deft blend of humor and raw honesty, brought to life by an outstanding performance by Charlize Theron.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: I'm not the biggest fan of The Purge franchise, it is one of those interesting concepts that was mishandled. I liked this film much to the displeasure of others by looking at the audience score currently at 2.5. The film was a little more interesting compared to the other films, mainly because of the political background and the lengths they will go to achieve an ideal. The film is full of violence and the third half of the film transcends into the roots of the franchise. This is probably the last in the franchise but considering the money it made, maybe not. If you're new to the franchise, this is a good jumping in point.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: The First Purge should satisfy fans of the franchise and filmgoers in the mood for violent vicarious thrills, even if its subtextual reach exceeds its grasp.</ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: I have never walked out of the cinema in during a movie. Night School is the first time. Going into this movie, I was expecting something somewhat OK, going off the trailers and other similar films that Kevin Hart has been in, e.g. Central Intelligence, Ride Along, etc. however, this film is nothing but an insult to cinema and comedy. The acting is tragic, the music is monotonous and it feels like they didn't even bother with the plot. Kevin Hart has great potential, but this is by far his worst performance in a long time, which is really disappointing to see from a comedian with such promise. Overall, if I could rate this a zero, I would.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: Night School's funny stars and seemingly promising setup add up to a disappointingly scattershot comedy whose laughs are largely held in detention.</ol>

					  <ol>User Review: A real life 30 year game of tag "you're it!" is the basis of this light summer comedy, that stars a pretty decent cast. You won't remember much of it afterwards, but you won't feel as if you've been gypped with half-assed, phoned-in performances miming a half-assed, phoned in script either. And it might well be rewatchable to boot. Okay stuff. </ol>

				  <p>Comment Reviews</p>
					  <ol>User Review: Blindspotting is a film with some very strong scenes interspersed inbetween a wider array of more or less average ones. It tries to delve into a series of heavyweight issues of the likes of racism and discrimination for the average non-white man living in today's world, and despite it trying to portray this via an unorthodox approach than usual, it doesn't always succeed in the delivery. That said, it does have its moments, but they are far and few. In addition to that, this film had an overall vibe that made it more suited to be acted out as a play than in a film.</ol>
					  <ol>Critic Review: As timely as it is overall impactful, Blindspotting blends buddy comedy with seething social commentary, and rises on the strength of Daveed Diggs' powerful performance.</ol>
